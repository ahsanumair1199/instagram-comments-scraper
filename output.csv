Looks crazy 🔥🔥
Yasssssss beef biryani! Looks perfect
Woohoo the BEST biryani is by Pakistani Shan Biryani Masala ❤️
Looks incredible is it spicy though? Like on a scale of 1-10? I can do about a 7ishhh
Shan spices actually slap
"When you first said “I’m making biryani” I was skeptical but kept watching and as a Pakistani, I can say this recipe is authentic!"
dont eat beef😡
Oh wow! A collaboration with Shan Masalas 😍 love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
So hapoy to see you make biryani! 👏
Eating biryani with your hands is the only way to eat it! 🙌
Happy to see u collaborating with a Pakistani brand 👏
Bro cooked someone's møm💀👍🏻
Shan Bombay Biryani spice mix is the 🐐!!!
I would shop at local Pakistani/Indian stores first and if not then go to Target.
"Congratulations on your collaboration!

You are, however, missing the accoutrement to biryani-dahi ki chutney (yogurt chutney). Trust me, it makes all the difference.

Here’s a quick recipe:
Handful of chopped cilantro
A few chopped green chilis
A diced onion
1/3 teaspoons of garlic powder, ginger powder and salt
3/4 cup plain yogurt
Water to thin out

*adjust seasonings to suit your taste"
omg our Pakistani SHAN masalay🙌 😍 Hands down the best @shanfoodsglobal
there is only way to eat good biryani and that’s w your hands 😍
Shan masala represent!!! @shanfoodsglobal
Favorite food of Indians 🗿

Biriyani ready made masala? fck no 👎
Hate from whole indian🙌😠
🔥🔥🔥
"I’m Bengali, out biriyani we don’t use tomatoes, there are many types of biriyani actually. I’m happy for your collaboration ❤"
I don't think anyone has ever made biryani with beef especially cos it's Indian cuisine and using beef would probably cause a riot lol
"Looks good, just use Coriander instead, cilantro not good"
Beef Biryani is superior>>>
Yes
@shanfoodsglobal spices are the best! A staple in every desi household ❤
Appreciate it man
Next pork biryani please

Shan spices are the best😍

I think insta is spying on me as I'm eating Mutton biryani
Omgggg❤️ @probablynotammar_ @amnanaseemsheikh @i_demonster I was not expecting HIM to make beef biryani hehehehhe
Brother eeehhh
Biryani is a perfect dish so now Bismilah
Please buddy don't cook beef with Indian species
Haha habibi come to hyderabad 😂
Some thing about watching a man eat with his hands😮‍💨😍
For me national biryani masala is better then shan
As always Bismillah is the best part ❤️❤️❤️
Bro intentionality want to hurt Hindus by putting beef in 'BOMBAY' BIRIYANI 😂 Burn like Palestinians
"People you don’t need to use a prepackaged spice mix to make delicious biryani! Take it from a Hyderabadi, these boxed spices will never match the flavor of authentic biryani. Instead use cumin, garam masala, turmeric, salt and red pepper instead of the boxed spice mix. The key is also using freshly ground ginger and frying a whole cinnamon stick, 6 cloves and 6 cardamom."
Shan spices cause cancer
As a Pakistani I got really excited seeing you make the beef biryani. And yes that looks damn good! 😍
"biryani, only hyderabadi"
My spices are supreme
❤️
Pushpek is watching be careful
Make chicken haleem with daal
"I hope your eat with your hands whenever you feel like it. Only have love for you, your culture, and other cultures"
Where those jealous Indians at??
Beef biryani>>>>>>>>>
I'm impressed you used the whole packet. My Mom doesn't even do that.
Bro knows what he was doing
Beef🤤😋🔥
Best Indian Food😍
Perfect 👏
Ahmed you should really check South Indian briyani Tamil Nadu one it like one pot and super delicious… btw we don’t use basmati for briyani here
Why no-one is talking about aloo (potato🥔)
Masahalla
you got that @shanfoodsglobal sponsorship!!
Bro made beef biriyani with chicken biryani masala 💀
"Gotta layer some fried onions, fresh mint and lemon slices at the top too 🇵🇰💯"
Sri Lankan here! I always make from scratch with spices and seeds and curry leaves but maybe the spice mix will help save time. Worth a shot
We call it big's biriyani 😂😂😂 bade ki biriyani😂
Bro is cooking someone's mom 😂
the right way to eat biryani is to eat it with hands👍
Next we want pork biryani 😢😢
Ahhhhhhh goldenbalance x shan let's goo

Where can I find Sean?
Make a tajine 🇲🇦🇲🇦
Thank you for showing how to make it; not as daunting as I thought. Does using ghee make a big difference?
Shan at TARGET?!
For everything National >>> Shan
"Not authentic biryani if you add tomato into it. For biryani: Hyderabad, India."

@ms.banusha_ a man of culture 😍
"There are a LOT of cooking pages on IG, too many honestly, yet yours is one of my absolute faves!! I love learning about new dishes, spices, culture, etc."
I’m from the UK … how big is Target??? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ here you can find it in any Asian grocery shops and large supermarkets
Biryani with tomatoes is not a biryani! Please.
Shan spices are at target now ?!! Omg. 😍
"Shan is amazingly good. I use them constantly. Ooooh, I am hungry!"
For authentic desi food flavors Shan Masalas are your quick and easy solution. Absolute GOAT🔥🔥🔥
"Basmati rice, spicy,and you all from India.. that add your product if India don't supply you food you all are eat yourself that's why people say islam is cancer for all a"
You’re collaborating w Shan🥲♥️
You gotta deep fry the onions man makes it 10000000x better. Make em crispy
👏 Next time buy Shan Nahari...heheh
Next try pork biryani recipe 🤤🤤
Pls no tomatoes in an authentic biryani there are no Tomatoes If you read this pls check out HYDERABADI DUM BIRYANI RECIPE
"Woah, that actually looks fire. And looks pretty simple to make as well"
Oh boy you just approved by all the Pakistanij aunties out there 😂
Looks so yummy! And without the question the only way to eat biryani is with your hands 🔥😍
Shan is yummy!! Been using this for years!
Bro Try the right way: the right Yemeni biryani
the fact that you ate biryani with your hands🥹🥹
You didn't add the potatoes!! But still looks good lol
Yummm my favorite ❤❤❤
We don't add tomatoes in biryani. In Hyderabad we cook biryani in complete different way.
You persianized the food
Bro is confirmed Pakistani from using Pakistani spice's
Sindhi biryani masala is much superior. Try that next and add potato too.
First you don’t use white onion 🤦🏽‍♂️
I recently bought some shan boxes but from a middleeastern grocery store. Haven't had a chance to try the ones I bought yet.
Only reason I’d go to Target is cause they sponsor you. @target you better pay this man handsomely💰
"wait wait wait, HOL UP🤚🏻.... The collaboration we NEEDED 🤩🤯🔥🥹"
Wow you’ve done a great job. Biryani made with Shan spice is amazing 🔥
as a pakistani i approveeeee 👏
Can someone clarify what is said at the end and its meaning please?!
valid
Shan are the worst spice company in my honest opinion. Just look at their ingredients list for the spices.
Can you make real biryani? Hyderabadi biryani
@faffilina they should be sponsoring you 👀
@y_gyu.n لك عيونووووو
Isn't it the same biryani from last reel?

"Bro, to make it taste even more delicious, add fried onions and lemon when you put it on the dum (for steam) and when you boil the rice, add green coriander."
Phenomenal 🔥🔥

Looks delicious 🤤
You nailed it bro. Looks delicious ❤️ keep the delicious foods coming 🔥
One thing I’d like to add is the “oil “ from the gravy should be put in the post first so the rice don’t stick at the bottom before you layer it with rice / meat/gravy .. 🙌
Stop im Hungry
🙌
Wow love it 👏
"There’s like a million diff ones btw, but finally Americans have access to them"
next time try some of the chicken tikka masala with the biryani mix...so yummmm!!!!
Looks amazing! Send some my way! 😊
@___yadii______ damn I wish I married a chef now 😂😭

😍😍😍
"“Beautiful spices”…. TF!? You clearly watch WAY too much @foodnetwork and pick up on their trash commentary. PLEASE… tell me, what’s so “beautiful” about them? 🥴"

Can you please show the measurements you used? Thank you
"Try their Sindhi Biryani masala, fuego."
you never added the second half of the masala 🤨
"there's no right way buddy , every culture has their own kind of Biryani"

Yummy😍😍😍
🇾🇪❤️‍🔥
I love watching you cook and I'm sure it's delicious but that is still not the right way for a biryani with all that tomatoes 😭
"As always, Indians getting offended for no reason."
let’s make 🐷🐖 biryani right way 😂
For your kind information it’s Pakistan brand ☺️
It's too salty I like National masalah
Shan masala is awesome 👌 you should try shan's faluda mix
Loved by all Indian so much ❤️
"I'm an areligious Indian🇮🇳 who enjoy Mythology of every sort whether be Dharmic or Abrahamic.
Let me tell you an Indian story of God began around 2000 BC in the times of Vedas.
In the beginning the formless, infinite, self-caused Being( परब्रह्म) symbolized as 🕉 created multiple universes and every universe has its three principle Lords: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh.
☆Brahma(ब्रह्मा) the Lord of creation(our world) made 10 Rishis(sages) by his mere thought and from these Rishis came all living beings of all sorts : Devtas(the 33 gods of wind, water, fire, earth, sky, Sun, Moon, death, riches etc.), Apsaras(the beings endowed with beauty and brain), Gandharwas(Divine musicians), Daityas(sons of diti, mostly materialistic beings with some exceptions), Garudas(hybrid beings with wings), Nagas(shape shifter snake spieces), Kamdhenu(from whom all cows and buffaloes were born that is why cows are sacred) , Ashwas( from who all the horse and related spieces were born) and other beings...
In the family of Devtas, Manu the First man was born from whom came the several generations of great men and women.
☆Vishnu is the Lord of every devtas. When disorder, evil abrupts in this world, Vishnu incarnates himself as an avtar to establish order and dharma.
☆Mahesh is the Lord of parlay(Doomsday).

The Conception of God in Hinduism is not that simple though. You'll need to study a lot books for it. Moreover Hinduism too has many sects and denominations like Islam and Christianity which have different interpretations of the same Theology. Some Hindus are strict monotheists some Trinitarians, some almost polytheists, some worshipp idols some don't. It is just a democratic nation when comes to belief in God. And every sect lives with peace with one another. No holy wars. No hate towards human beings."

❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
"Wait, you said half of our masala. What did you do with the rest? Wese you can have the biryani qorma with roti as well. Or save it for a second batch for some other time."
"A tip from a biryani lover in khi. 1. Let the onion turn golden brown and let the tomatoes cook completely before putting in the beef. 2. Add zeera (cumin), mint leaves and a green chilli or two to rice water when its boiling before you put in the rice. 3. Sprinkle a few drops of arq e kewra before putting on the foil."
Pakistan’s only big win y’ll💀
Those are my fav spices for making Indian or Pakistani food!
Bro cooked beed with our ingredients
Now try pork also😂

"For all my Indians crying because he used beef I would like to tell you something about your own country that will make you shock . In North India beef is banned but in South India beef is consumed by everyone even the Hindus of South India eat beef , have knowledge about your own country before you comment 🇮🇳❤️"
Just add 4 potatoes. And perfect❤️
Anyone want to learn Quran
@pushpeksidhu_
😋😍
I would advice to start the layering with the meat first so that your rice doesn't get burnt. Another tip Try mixing the shan packet with yoghurt as a paste then add it to your meat makes a big difference in taste!!
❤
You always make some beautiful dishes
Bro that actually looks like my mother’s biryani 🤤
Shaan is a global staple
So much onion it'll taste sweet brhuu😂

Uzbekistan————————->plov
I am afraid for bro the Hindu extremists are coming for the comments
"That's not the right way. That's quick and easy way. I have tried Shan spice for butter chicken, it does not taste the same as using actual spices"
Beef😍

"Daaamn, missing a real nice Beef Biriyani, all the places only have Chicken or Lamb 😢"
Wonder what @pushpeksidhu_ would think of this
Don't care karma will be back
Iraqi Biryani has beef and chicken.
"you should have used the receipe written at the back of tha packet ,rhats more authentic and bomb receipe."
"No worry,he was just cooking his mother🗿🗿🗿🗿 jai shree ram🚩🚩"

Man I love biryani
@pushpeksidhu_

Do you guys know Pakistani ppl use these spices to cook beef every single day 💀

Why are both Muslims and Hindus pressed in the comments? All he did was cook💀
It's not biryani if you add tomatoes 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

Hey bro pls send your address I sent you Jesus ass biryani

"idk why, i like you Ahmad, but why do you sound like that? like food is in your mouth all the time and you extend what you say like salsaaa or even words that don't end with the letter A lol you just sound like you are gurgling and your words are heavy weighted and everything is a exclamation mark
lmao idk. that's the way i put it. does anyone else hear it??? or is it just me. mybe you are just really passionate when you cook, really excited talking abt the food. it's just an observation i made. not tryna disrespect at all. i like you. you're entertaining. your clips are nicely done and everything you dish out looks super tasty. you are a chef chef!! id devour anything you make."

Don't put tomatoes or potatoes.. it's not required in real biryani
1❌️ 2- or more layers✅️
Shan knew what they were doing partnering w u!
"How do you Arab, Desi, and African folks eat with your hands without getting messy? Whenever I try, the rice and whatever (curry, stew, etc) slides out of my hands between my fingers 😢"
shan is the BESTTTT
"There's actually something wrong with some of the people in the comments. You guys take time to make anything and everything about someone else's religion, whether it be Muslims or Hindus. Please do better as people."
You are meant to eat biryani with your hands

This..... was..... so beautiful 🥲✨️
Yummm 😍
So cool that target carries this now
Mashalla you are making my favorite dish 🥰😍
"This is awesome! Great job showcasing this recipe!! For next time, I recommend marinating the meat with the spices and yogurt overnight for an even juicier flavor. You’ll love it even more! 😊"
where’s the aloo 🥲
did he just say garlic?? #heartburn
"I use both the tandoori masala and chicken tikka masala almost every day to marinate my chicken for literally anything I cook, I add a bit of achar gosht mix to it bc I like the lemony taste, and some garlic powder, salt, chilli flakes, coriander powder and crushed black pepper, marinate for a few hours and then grill on my George Foreman and it’s amazing every time. Sometimes I add a bit of sumac too. It’s so flavourful for literally anything eg cut up chicken and use in pasta, noodles, in butter chicken, Chinese rice with some sauce, shredded in sliders, cream cheese taquitos, literally anything 😍"
Yessss
Where is the potato ??
They sell Shan at target ??😂
Daaaaaaaaaayum they got Shan masala at Target now? Desi people in the rise. 😂
"Yay as a Pakistani, I can tell you there are many variations and your method is veryyyy authentic. Next time put some dried apricots ( aloo bukhara ), mint leaves, potatoes and lemon for a kick 🥲 @thegoldenbalance"
@bedgny

Target is so much >>> I love that they have these products and that they are so diverse.
Where can I find your recipes? 😍
"I like when my mom adds the dried apricots, gives it a bit of a sweet flavour. Regardless this looks amazing. Will save"
Wow we in Target now?! Cool! I will still buy from my local Desi stores to support small business but it’s great exposure for others who aren’t familiar with Shan brand. Also you did a great job with the biryani! 😍

Oh if you are new to desi cooking shan is your goto masala packet. As you become more comfortable i would recommend use your natural spices to cook biryani.

"We call it Kalyani Biryani in Hyderabad, named after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar, who came to Hyderabad in the 18th century"
"As a person who grew up on biriyani, he did it right. I thought this was going to be Arabized version of biriyani. Good job brother."
